# Running This Script
- Place the files (`consoleSudoku.py`, `README.md`, `puzzles.json` and `main.py`) into a desired directory.
- Copy the path of a desired `.txt` file of wrestler names and rivalries in the same directory where these files are located (this file could be located in the same directory as `consoleSudoku.py` and `graph_vertex.py`, but it need not be as long as you can copy the path).

# Test wrestlers.py
- In order to test the `consoleSudoku.py` script, run the command `python consoleSudoku.py`.
- This will run a command line interface to Console Sudoku. 

When Console Sudoku opens, you will see the <b>Console Sudoku Main Menu</b>. Here you may read a short description about the rules of Sudoku by entering `1` or you may load a random Sudoku puzzle from the puzzle library and load the <b>Puzzle Selection Menu</b> by entering `2`. You may also enter `Q` at any time to exit Console Sudoku.

<b>Puzzle Selection Menu</b>
This menu allows you to perform the following options:
 - Attempt to solve the randomly selected puzzle by opening the puzzle and allowing the user to fill out and place numbers on the Sudoku board and submit the puzzle for validation (Step 3 of the Assignment)
 - Generate and view a valid solution to the randomly selected puzzle (Bonus A of the Assignment)
 - Return to the Console Sudoku Main Menu

Note: Additional screenshots of the menus and functions of Console Sudoku can also be found in the accompanying `HollandCS325PortfolioProject.pdf` file.
